# helloworld-in-c

How "Hello, World!" program works?

- The `#include` is a preprocessor command that tells the compiler to include the contents of `stdio.h` (standard input and output) file in the program.

- The `stdio.h `file contains functions such as `scanf()` and `printf()` to take input and display output respectively.

- If you use the `printf()` function without writing `#include` `<stdio.h>`, the program will not compile.

- The execution of a C program starts from the `main()` function.

- `printf()` is a library function to send formatted output to the screen. In this program, `printf()` displays Hello, World! text on the screen.

- The `return 0`; statement is the **"Exit status"** of the program. In simple terms, the program ends with this statement.
